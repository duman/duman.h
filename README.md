# duman.h

This is a library file that I've written for C++, Windows, Visual Studio. Feel free to contribute and add your own functions in it. Send some request and I'll add them after I verify that it works with different systems.

It's pretty basic so far but I'll keep updating it as I go.

If you have better solutions than already existing ones, you're also free to modify the existing code. For example `void ping_url(const string& url)` function, uses `system()` function, which many consider as evil.

It only uses existing Windows libraries to solve those problems, no external library is needed to use them.

That's it for now. Go ahead, take a look, have fun.
